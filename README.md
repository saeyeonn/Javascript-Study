### JS in seperate file

<br>

- Visual appeal
Individual HTML and JS files become more readable.

- Access among HTML files
We can have multiple HTML files that all share same JS.

- Collaboration
We can easily have one person work on JS while another works on HTML.

- Import
We are able to import JS libs that other people have aloready written. (e.g. Bootstrap)

### JavaScript Console

<br>

- Useful tool for testing out small bits of code and debugging.

- We can find write and run JS code in console, which can be found by inspecting element in web brower then clicking console.

- Printing to consol is an useful tool for debugging.

```javascript
// EX - can print all by selecting all buttons in page
console.log(document.querySelectorAll('button'));
```
